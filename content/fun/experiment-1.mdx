## Concept

This project started as a weekend experiment to push the boundaries of typography beyond traditional 2D layouts. I wanted to explore how letterforms could exist in three-dimensional space and interact with light and shadow.

### Tools Used

- **Spline**: For 3D modeling and scene setup
- **After Effects**: For final animation and compositing
- **Cinema 4D**: For complex geometry and physics simulations

### Process

I began by sketching various letterform concepts, focusing on geometric shapes that would translate well into 3D. The goal was to maintain readability while creating visual interest through depth and perspective.

The final piece features:
- Custom 3D letterforms with beveled edges
- Dynamic lighting setup with colored gels
- Subtle rotation animation
- Reflective materials for visual depth

### Learnings

Working in 3D space completely changed how I think about typography. Considerations like viewing angle, lighting direction, and material properties became just as important as traditional type metrics like kerning and leading.

This exploration has influenced my recent UI design work, where I've started incorporating more depth and dimensional effects to create hierarchy and focus.
