## Overview

This experimental project explores the intersection of code and design through a generative pattern system. Each pattern is unique, created by algorithms that respond to various inputs like mouse movement, time of day, and ambient noise.

### Technical Setup

Built with:
- **p5.js**: For canvas rendering and animation
- **Tone.js**: For audio-reactive features
- **dat.GUI**: For real-time parameter control

### How It Works

The system uses several algorithms working together:

1. **Grid Generation**: Creates a base grid with variable density
2. **Shape Distribution**: Places geometric primitives based on noise functions
3. **Color Mapping**: Applies color gradients based on position and time
4. **Animation**: Animates elements using perlin noise for organic movement

### Interactive Features

- **Mouse Position**: Influences pattern density and rotation
- **Audio Input**: Microphone input affects shape size and frequency
- **Time-Based**: Patterns evolve throughout the day with different color palettes

### Applications

While this started as pure experimentation, I've found practical applications:
- Custom background generators for design presentations
- Unique hero sections for web projects
- Inspiration for static design systems

The most exciting discovery was how generative systems can inform traditional design decisions. The unexpected combinations created by the algorithm often led to color pairings and compositions I wouldn't have considered manually.

### Future Directions

I'm planning to expand this into a full design tool where users can:
- Save and export their favorite patterns
- Use patterns as SVG backgrounds in web projects
- Create print-ready versions for physical applications
- Share and remix patterns with the community
