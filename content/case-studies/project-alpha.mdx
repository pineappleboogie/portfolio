## Overview

Project Alpha was a comprehensive redesign of Alpha Bank's mobile banking application. The goal was to modernize the user experience and make financial management more accessible to younger users while maintaining security and trust.

### The Challenge

The existing app had a 2.3-star rating on app stores, with users complaining about:
- Complex navigation that made simple tasks difficult
- Outdated visual design that felt disconnected from modern banking needs
- Poor accessibility for users with disabilities
- Lack of personalization and insights

### My Role

As the Lead UX Designer, I was responsible for:
- Conducting user research and competitive analysis
- Creating user flows and wireframes
- Designing high-fidelity prototypes
- Leading usability testing sessions
- Collaborating with developers during implementation

## Research & Discovery

We conducted interviews with 25 users across different age groups and analyzed app store reviews to identify pain points. Key findings included:

1. **Navigation Complexity**: Users struggled to find basic features like transfers and statements
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information was buried in dense text blocks
3. **Trust Issues**: The outdated design made users question the app's security

### User Personas

We developed three primary personas:
- **Sarah (26)**: Young professional who wants quick access to spending insights
- **Michael (42)**: Business owner who needs efficient transaction management
- **Elena (65)**: Retiree who values simplicity and larger touch targets

## Design Solution

### Simplified Navigation

I redesigned the navigation with a bottom tab bar featuring four core sections:
- Home (personalized dashboard)
- Accounts (balance overview)
- Pay (transfers & payments)
- More (settings & support)

### Visual Redesign

The new design featured:
- A clean, modern color palette that conveyed trust and professionalism
- Increased contrast ratios to meet WCAG AA standards
- Consistent spacing and typography using an 8pt grid system
- Custom illustrations to make complex financial concepts approachable

### Personalized Dashboard

The home screen now displays:
- Real-time balance and recent transactions
- Spending insights and budgeting tools
- Quick actions for frequent tasks
- Personalized financial tips

## Results

After launching the redesigned app:
- App store rating increased from 2.3 to 4.7 stars
- User task completion rate improved by 68%
- Support tickets decreased by 45%
- Daily active users increased by 32%

## Key Learnings

1. **Accessibility is essential**: Designing for accessibility improved the experience for all users
2. **Simple navigation wins**: Reducing cognitive load through clear navigation significantly improved usability
3. **Test early and often**: Regular usability testing helped us catch and fix issues before development
